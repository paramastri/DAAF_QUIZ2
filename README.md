## A Simple Tour Guide Application

We create a simple application that implements the Dijkstra algorithm.

The large number of tourists who are traveling and struggling to find the most effective distance that they can travel to their destination makes us inspired to make this program. So here we provide a solution for them, through a simple application that implements the Dijkstra algorithm, and is expected that later it will be able to help solve their problem.

1.	User can input the number of cities (origin and destination).
2.	The user inputs how many paths are passed.
3.	Users input how many kilometers (km) distance from one city to another, which in this application is represented by alphabet. Example: [City 1] [City 2] [Distance].
4.	The program will display lists of alternative information between cities and their distances.
5.	From this information, user can enter their current location.
6.	Finally, the program displays the shortest route from the current location to all the destination cities that have been entered earlier.
